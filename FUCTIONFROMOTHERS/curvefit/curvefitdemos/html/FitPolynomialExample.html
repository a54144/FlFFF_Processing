%% Polynomial Curve Fitting
%
% This example shows how to fit polynomials up to sixth degree to some census
% data using Curve Fitting Toolbox(TM). It also shows how to fit a single-term
% exponential equation and compare this to the polynomial models.
%
% The steps show how to:
%
% * Load data and create fits using different library models.
% * Search for the best fit by comparing graphical fit results, and by comparing
% numerical fit results including the fitted coefficients and goodness of fit
% statistics.

%% Load and Plot the Data
%
% The data for this example is the file |census.mat|
load census
%%
% The workspace contains two new variables:
%
% * |cdate| is a column vector containing the years 1790 to 1990 in 10-year
% increments.
% * |pop| is a column vector with the U.S. population figures that correspond to
% the years in |cdate| .
whos cdate pop
plot( cdate, pop, 'o' )

%% Create and Plot a Quadratic
%
% Use the |fit| function to fit a a polynomial to data. You specify a
% quadratic, or second-degree polynomial, with the string |'poly2'|.
% The first output from |fit| is the polynomial, and the second output,
% |gof|, contains the goodness of fit statistics you will examine in a
% later step.
[population2, gof] = fit( cdate, pop,  'poly2' );
%%
% To plot the fit, use the |plot| method.
plot( population2, cdate, pop );
% Move the legend to the top left corner.
legend( 'Location', 'NorthWest' );

%% Create and Plot a Selection of Polynomials
%
% To fit polynomials of different degrees, change the fittype string, e.g., for a
% cubic or third-degree polynomial use |'poly3'|. The scale of the input,
% |cdate|, is quite large, so you can obtain better results by centering and
% scaling the data. To do this, use the |'Normalize'| option.
population3 = fit( cdate, pop, 'poly3', 'Normalize', 'on' );
population4 = fit( cdate, pop, 'poly4', 'Normalize', 'on' );
population5 = fit( cdate, pop, 'poly5', 'Normalize', 'on' );
population6 = fit( cdate, pop, 'poly6', 'Normalize', 'on' );
%%
% A simple model for population growth tells us that an exponential
% equation should fit this census data well. To fit a single term
% exponential model, use |'exp1'| as the fittype.
populationExp = fit( cdate, pop,  'exp1' );
%%
% Plot all the fits at once, and add a meaningful legend in the top left
% corner of the plot.
hold on
plot( population3, 'b' );
plot( population4, 'g' );
plot( population5, 'm' );
plot( population6, 'bREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH' );
plot( populationExp, 'rREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH' );
hold off
legend( 'cdate v pop', 'poly2', 'poly3', 'poly4', 'poly5', 'poly6', 'exp1', ...
    'Location', 'NorthWest' );

%% Plot the Residuals to Evaluate the Fit
%
% To plot residuals, specify |'residuals'| as the plot type in the |plot|
% method.
plot( population2, cdate, pop, 'residuals' );
%%
% The fits and residuals for the polynomial equations are all similar,
% making it difficult to choose the best one.
%
% If the residuals display a systematic pattern, it is a clear sign that
% the model fits the data poorly.
plot( populationExp, cdate, pop, 'residuals' );
%%
% The fit and residuals for the single-term exponential equation indicate
% it is a poor fit overall. Therefore, it is a poor choice and you can
% remove the exponential fit from the candidates for best fit.

%% Examine Fits Beyond the Data Range
%
% Examine the behavior of the fits up to the year 2050. The goal of fitting
% the census data is to extrapolate the best fit to predict future
% population values.
%
% By default, the fit is plotted over the range of the data. To plot a fit
% over a different range, set the x-limits of the axes before plotting the
% fit. For example, to see values extrapolated from the fit, set the upper
% x-limit to 2050.
plot( cdate, pop, 'o' );
xlim( [1900, 2050] );
hold on
plot( population6 );
hold off
%%
% Examine the plot. The behavior of the sixth-degree polynomial fit beyond
% the data range makes it a poor choice for extrapolation and you can
% reject this fit.

%% Plot Prediction Intervals
%
% To plot prediction intervals, use |'predobs'| or |'predfun'| as the plot
% type. For example, to see the prediction bounds for the fifth-degree
% polynomial for a new observation up to year 2050:
plot( cdate, pop, 'o' );
xlim( [1900, 2050] )
hold on
plot( population5, 'predobs' );
hold off

%%
% Plot prediction intervals for the cubic polynomial up to year 2050:
plot( cdate, pop, 'o' );
xlim( [1900, 2050] )
hold on
plot( population3, 'predobs' )
hold off

%% Examine Goodness-of-Fit Statistics
% The struct |gof| shows the goodness-of-fit statistics for the |'poly2'|
% fit. When you created the |'poly2'| fit with the |fit| function in an earlier
% step, you specified the |gof| output argument.
gof
%%
% Examine the sum of squares due to error (SSE) and the adjusted R-square
% statistics to help determine the best fit. The SSE statistic is the
% least-squares error of the fit, with a value closer to zero indicating a
% better fit. The adjusted R-square statistic is generally the best
% indicator of the fit quality when you add additional coefficients to your
% model.
%
% The large SSE for |'exp1'| indicates it is a poor fit, which you already
% determined by examining the fit and residuals. The lowest SSE value is
% associated with |'poly6'|. However, the behavior of this fit beyond the data
% range makes it a poor choice for extrapolation, so you already rejected
% this fit by examining the plots with new axis limits.
%
% The next best SSE value is associated with the fifth-degree polynomial
% fit, |'poly5'|, suggesting it might be the best fit. However, the SSE and
% adjusted R-square values for the remaining polynomial fits are all very
% close to each other. Which one should you choose?

%% Compare the Coefficients and Confidence Bounds to Determine the Best Fit
%
% Resolve the best fit issue by examining the coefficients and confidence
% bounds for the remaining fits: the fifth-degree polynomial and the
% quadratic.
%
% Examine |population2| and |population5| by displaying the models, the fitted coefficients,
% and the confidence bounds for the fitted coefficients:
population2
%%
population5
%%
% You can also get the confidence intervals by using |confint| :
ci = confint( population5 )
%%
% The confidence bounds on the coefficients determine their accuracy. Check
% the fit equations (e.g. |f(x)=p1*x+p2*x...| ) to see the model terms for
% each coefficient. Note that |p2| refers to the |p2*x| term in |'poly2'| and the
% |p2*x^4| term in |'poly5'|. Do not compare normalized coefficients directly
% with non-normalized coefficients.
%
% The bounds cross zero on the |p1|, |p2|, and |p3| coefficients for the
% fifth-degree polynomial. This means you cannot be sure that these
% coefficients differ from zero. If the higher order model terms may have
% coefficients of zero, they are not helping with the fit, which suggests
% that this model over fits the census data.
%
% The fitted coefficients associated with the constant, linear, and
% quadratic terms are nearly identical for each normalized polynomial
% equation. However, as the polynomial degree increases, the coefficient
% bounds associated with the higher degree terms cross zero, which
% suggests over fitting.
%
% However, the small confidence bounds do not cross zero on |p1|, |p2|, and
% |p3| for the quadratic fit, indicating that the fitted coefficients are
% known fairly accurately.
%
% Therefore, after examining both the graphical and numerical fit results,
% you should select the quadratic |population2| as the best fit to extrapolate the
% census data.

%% Evaluate the Best Fit at New Query Points
%
% Now you have selected the best fit, |population2|, for extrapolating this census data,
% evaluate the fit for some new query points:
cdateFuture = (2000:10:2020).';
popFuture = population2( cdateFuture )
%%
% To compute 95% confidence bounds on the prediction for the population in the
% future, use the |predint| method:
ci = predint( population2, cdateFuture, 0.95, 'observation' )
%%
% Plot the predicted future population, with confidence intervals, against the
% fit and data.
plot( cdate, pop, 'o' );
xlim( [1900, 2040] )
hold on
plot( population2 )
h = errorbar( cdateFuture, popFuture, popFuture-ci(:,1), ci(:,2)-popFuture, '.' );
