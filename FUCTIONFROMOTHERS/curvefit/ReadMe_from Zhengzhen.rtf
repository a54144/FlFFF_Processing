\f0\fs24 \cf0 This whole folder "curvefit" was copied from a PC version of Matlab 2013a, from Dr. Jianyu Ni (originally it was from Jianyu Ni, but the copy that I got was from Steve Devilbiss, who got his copy originally from Jianyu Ni.)\
This would be the so called Curve Fitting Toolbox.\
This is a new toolbox, available with Matlab 2013a, but not available with Matlab 2010a.}
